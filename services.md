I use public access satellite and geospatial datasets for mapping land cover and analysing land cover change. My methods include the use of machine learning techniques implemented using the Python progamming language and ground-truthing using high resolution imagery. This allows me to provide accurate products at an affordable price. 

My services include:
* [Land cover mapping]() 
* [Land cover change detection]()
* [Land clearing monitoring]()
* [Urban heat mapping]()
* [Bushfire extent and recovery mapping]()
