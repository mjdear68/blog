I use freely available satellite and geospatial datasets for mapping land cover and analysing land cover change. My methods include the use of machine learning techniques implemented using the Python progamming language. This allows me to provide accurate products at an affordable price. 

The following list is a selection of the services I offer. Follow the links for a detailed description.
* [Land cover mapping]() 
* [Land cover change detection]()
* [Land clearing monitoring]()
* [Urban heat mapping]()
* [Bushfire extent and recovery mapping]()
