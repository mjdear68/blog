## Bio
From 2004 to 2023 I was a high school teacher of mathematics with the NSW Department of Education. During this time I developed an interest in statistics and data analysis, which led me to complete the the Graduate Diploma in Science (Applied Statistics) with the University of New England, Australia in 2021-2024. As a part of this course, I completed a research project in which I used a 36-year Landsat NDVI time series to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation in the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW. Based on this experience, I am now pursuing a career in remote sensing and geospatial analysis.

## Services
I use freely available satellite and geospatial datasets for mapping land cover and analysing land cover change. My methods include the use of machine learning techniques implemented using the Python progamming language. This allows me to provide accurate products at an affordable price.

The following list is a selection of the services I offer. Follow the links for a detailed description.
* [Land cover mapping]() 
* [Land cover change detection]()
* [Land clearing monitoring]()
* [Urban heat mapping]()
* [Bushfire extent and recovery mapping]()
