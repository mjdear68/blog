From 2004 to 2023 I was a high school teacher of mathematics with the NSW Department of Education. During this time I developed an interest in statistics and data analysis, which led me to complete the the Graduate Diploma in Science (Applied Statistics) with the University of New England, Australia in 2021-2024. As a part of this course, I completed a research project in which I used a 36-year Landsat NDVI time series to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation in the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW. Based on this experience, I am now pursuing a career in remote sensing and geospatial analysis.
